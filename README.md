## Rules
- Don't let the ball get past your paddle!
- First to five wins!

## How To Play
- Have your UCFK4 rotated horizontally so that the navswitch is on the side closest to you
- When both players are ready, one player presses the navswitch and that is the player who starts with the ball
- Both players will get a paddle on their screen, and the player who readied up first will have a ball
- Move the paddle by pushing the navswitch left and right
- If the ball hits your paddle it will bounce off it and head towards the opponent
- If the ball misses your paddle, the opponent gets a point and this will appear on your screen
- To reset the game after a point is scored, press the navswitch again, just like you did to start the game
- The game carries on until a player's score reaches five
- When a player's score reaches five, the losing player will get a display saying "Defeat!" and the winner "Victory!"
- To get back to the starting screen, press the navswitch
